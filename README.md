# Weather-Dashboard-Third-Party-APIs

## Description

### Problem:
As a traveler, it can be difficult to plan a trip without knowing the weather outlook for 
multiple cities. It can be time-consuming to search for weather information for each city 
individually, and keeping track of multiple cities' weather conditions can be overwhelming.

### Solution:
The weather dashboard application provides a solution to this problem by allowing users to 
search for multiple cities and view the current and future weather conditions for each 
city. The user can easily add cities to their search history and view the weather 
conditions for those cities again later.

When the user searches for a city, the application retrieves the current and future weather 
conditions for that city from the openweathermap.org API and displays the information in a 
clear and intuitive format. The user can see the city name, date, icon representation of 
weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the current weather 
conditions. For the future weather conditions, the user can see a 5-day forecast that 
displays the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and 
humidity.

The search history feature allows the user to easily access weather information for 
previously searched cities. When the user clicks on a city in the search history, the 
current and future weather conditions for that city are displayed again.

Overall, the weather dashboard application provides a convenient and user-friendly solution 
for travelers who want to plan their trips according to the weather outlook for multiple 
cities.
